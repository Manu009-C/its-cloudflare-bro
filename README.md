# its-cloudflare-bro

> “It’s not down.  
> It’s Cloudflare, bro.”

A **parody HTML error page** inspired by the *vibe* of Cloudflare-style outage screens, created as a joke reference for when **something, somewhere, is mysteriously broken again**.

Drop it into a project, link it in a group chat, or post it whenever an outage inevitably gets blamed on Cloudflare.

## 🫠 Why Does This Exist?

Because every outage has a phase where someone says:

> “It’s Cloudflare, bro.”

And now there’s a page for that.

*“its-cloudflare-bro” is a joke name.

They are probably having a day.*
